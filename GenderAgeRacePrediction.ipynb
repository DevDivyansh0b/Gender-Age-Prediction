    "Choosing between the Functional API and Sequential API in Keras depends on the complexity and flexibility of your neural network architecture. Both APIs are powerful and suitable for different scenarios. Here are some considerations that might help you decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: The Sequential API is straightforward and easy to use, especially when your neural network is a linear stack of layers. If your model can be represented as a simple sequence of layers (input to output), the Sequential API is a good choice.\n",

    "    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n",

    "Functional API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Models: If your model requires multiple inputs, shared layers, or has complex architectures such as multi-branch models, skip connections, or residual connections, the Functional API is more suitable.\n",
    "Flexibility: The Functional API provides more flexibility in connecting layers. You can easily create models with multiple inputs and outputs, and you have more control over the connections between layers.\n",
    "Feature Sharing: When you need to share layers between different parts of the model (e.g., siamese networks).\n",
